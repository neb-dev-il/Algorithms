## String-Challenge-1

String Challenge Have the function StringChallenge(str) take the str parameter being passed and return a compressed version of the string using the Run-length encoding algorithm. This algorithm works by taking the occurrence of each repeating character and outputting that number along with a single character of the repeating sequence. For example: "wwwggopp" would return 3w2g1o2p. The string will not contain any numbers, punctuation, or symbols. Examples Input: "aabbcde" Output: 2a2b1c1d1e Input: "wwwbbbw" Output: 3w3b1w
